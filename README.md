## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### **1️⃣ Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nidhi18-git/ML-Project-With-Flask.git
cd ML-Project-With-Flask
2️⃣ Create a virtual environment (Recommended)
bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
3️⃣ Install dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🎯 Running the Flask App
After setting up the environment, run the Flask server using:

bash
python app.py
Once running, open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.

⚙️ How It Works
Train the Model

Uses scikit-learn for training
Saves the model as model.pkl
Saves the scaler as scaler.pkl
Deploy with Flask

Serves predictions via a REST API
Accepts input via a web form or API request
Endpoints

/ → Home Page (Web Form)
/predict → API endpoint to make predictions
📬 API Usage
1️⃣ Request Example
Send a POST request with JSON input:

json
{
    "feature1": 5.1,
    "feature2": 3.5,
    "feature3": 1.4,
    "feature4": 0.2
}
2️⃣ Response Example
json
{
    "prediction": "Class A"
}
🎨 Frontend UI
A simple HTML frontend (inside templates/) is included, allowing users to input data and get predictions.
